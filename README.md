Over here, a myriad of mental wellness resources can be found. You can save an article for future read. 
Fret not that the content would become outdated, because our trusted feed providers do update regularly :)

Play some music (generated from Spotify) and jot down some thoughts with a guided prompt to wind down from your day!

# Final Note
Sadly, there are still some necessary features that are not fully integrated (like logging out, validation of password, security features), so this app would not be launched. 
However, if anyone feels that the purpose and features of this app is amazing and you want to experience it, do share with the owner (me)! 
I would then perhaps consider opening this archive up and burn some nights to launch it.

Till then, this will lie as a piece of work I am proud of exploring. 
Flutter really saved my nightmare from vanilla Android coding experience (laughs)
